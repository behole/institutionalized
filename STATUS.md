## 📈 Metrics

- **Frameworks Implemented**: 20 / 26 cataloged (77%)
- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000+ (estimated)
- **Packages**: 22 (core + 20 frameworks + mcp-server)
- **Examples**: 6
- **Documentation Files**: 15+
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Unit tests: 32 passing (orchestrator, validators)
  - E2E tests: 3 passing (courtroom, six-hats, pre-mortem)
  - Total expect() calls: 71+

## 🎯 Next Priorities

1. **OSS Release** - Publish to GitHub & npm
2. **Additional Frameworks** - Implement remaining 6 frameworks (reach 26/26)
3. **Additional E2E Tests** - Add E2E tests for remaining 17 frameworks
4. **Documentation** - Individual framework READMEs
5. **Community** - Website, tutorials, Discord

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The library is **fully functional** for:
- ✅ CLI usage (all 20 frameworks)
- ✅ Programmatic usage (import frameworks directly)
- ✅ MCP integration (Claude Code and other MCP clients)
- ✅ Multi-provider LLM support
- ✅ Full observability and cost tracking

## 📝 Notes

- All frameworks follow consistent patterns
- Shared core reduces duplication
- MCP integration makes frameworks accessible in Claude Code
- Ready for beta testing and community feedback
- Strong foundation for scaling to 26+ frameworks
