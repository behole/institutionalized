  "question": "Should I merge this pull request that refactors our authentication system?",
  "context": [
    "PR refactors authentication from custom implementation to using industry-standard OAuth 2.0 library",
    "All tests pass (97% coverage maintained)",
    "Code review from 2 senior engineers: both approved with minor suggestions addressed",
    "Breaking change: requires users to re-authenticate once after deployment",
    "Benefits: Better security, easier maintenance, supports SSO in future",
    "Risks: Authentication is critical path, refactor touches 15 files, deployment needs coordination",
    "Timeline: Want to include in next week's release, otherwise delayed 2 weeks",
    "Alternative: Could deploy to staging for 1 more week, but slows velocity"
